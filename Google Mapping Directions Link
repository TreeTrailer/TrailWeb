I came across the below snippet online, last year.

Add it to Events Manager Settings:

Formatting > Location > Single Location Page > Single location page format

<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/#_LOCATIONADDRESS, #_LOCATIONTOWN, #_LOCATIONSTATE, #_LOCATIONPOSTCODE" target="_new" >Google Mapping</a><br/>
